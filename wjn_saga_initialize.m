%EXAMPLE - Sample data from device and store as a Poly5 file.
%   Sample data from the device and stream the data to a Poly5 file. This
%   will not keep the data in memory and will stream the data as soon as
%   possible to the harddrive. Should be used in long running experiments.
% 
%   When closing the realtime plot window, sampling will stop.
